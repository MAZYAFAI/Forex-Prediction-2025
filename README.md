## Background
This project, part of a series on machine learning, evaluates traditional and advanced models for forecasting currency forex pair trends. I compared **ARIMA, LSTM, AutoTS, and FBProphet-models** ideal for handling temporal patterns and seasonality.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning
In this machine learning project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and data cleaning are vital for success. By thoroughly understanding and cleaning the data, and applying optimal preprocessing techniques, I establish a strong foundation for accurate predictions. These steps help identify patterns, address anomalies, and format the data (e.g., currencies as float, time as datetime) to enhance model performance. Additional tasks include trend analysis and checking data distribution for outliers and skewness.
